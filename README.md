# IBM_Recommendation_Project
To complete this project I am analyzing the interactions that the users having articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. 

This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree by [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/). It features an important collaboration with IBM, the provider of the dataset. The aim is to develop a recommendation engine and suggest new articles to the [IBM Watson Community].
